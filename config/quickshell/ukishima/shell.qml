/**
 * Ukishima top shell. Each monitor carries two layer-shell windows:
 *
 *  - `reserve` is a zero-content strip that only claims an exclusive zone the
 *    height of the rest pill, so tiled windows always sit below the pill even
 *    while it is expanded or a surface is open.
 *  - `overlay` is a full-screen transparent Overlay layer hosting the single
 *    morphing pill anchored at top-centre. The pill never moves windows and is
 *    never re-parented; it just grows in place, so every surface grows out of
 *    the rest pill instead of popping up as a separate panel.
 *
 * Input is routed by the window mask. While the pill is collapsed the mask is
 * the pill rect only, so the rest of the screen clicks through to windows.
 * While the pill is expanded (hovered/pinned) or a surface is open the mask is
 * cleared so the whole layer catches clicks. A backdrop press dismisses, and
 * keyboard focus is taken on demand so Escape closes the open surface.

             * off the bottom edge, because the panel holds the "Dock" switch and
             * the bar holds the gear. Two things make that work.
             *
             * It is a SIBLING of the bar, and it anchors to the bar's layout
             * position — a Transform moves the painting, not `x`/`y`, so
             * anchoring here reads the untranslated position and the panel holds
             * still while the bar slides away.
             *
             * And the shell, not the dock, decides the panel's palette input and
             * its input-mask region, because the mask has to cover the panel
             * alone in `dockForcedOpen` — the bar is gone, so the union would be
             * wrong.
             *
             * Loaded, not instantiated, so the app list's desktop-entry scan is
             * not paid for while the panel is closed. Its size is left entirely
             * to the Loader's own implicit sizing, which follows the page's
             * `implicitWidth`/`implicitHeight`: binding `width` to `item.width`
             * looks equivalent and is not — the Loader resizes a loaded item to
             * its own width, so on the tick the item appears the width reads 0,
                 * the Loader resizes the page to 0, and the two pin each other at
             * zero. That is the panel's own input-mask region, so a silent zero
             * there is a panel that draws and takes no clicks.
