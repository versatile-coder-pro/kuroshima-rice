# Ukishima dependency check — the single reporter for what the shell needs.
#
# Everything it reports comes from dependencies.json at the repo root, so this
# script, remote-install.sh and DEPENDENCIES.md cannot disagree about what a
# dependency is. The point of the manifest is that adding a dependency becomes a
# one-line declarative change here, which is what lets the post-update report
# tell an existing user "this update now needs X" without anyone writing a
# bespoke message.
#
# It is deliberately a shell script rather than part of the shell: the update it
# guards against can be a dependency whose absence stops the shell from loading
# at all (an unresolvable QML import), and code that fails to load cannot report
# its own missing dependencies.
#
# Usage:
#   check-deps.sh              report to stdout; exit 1 if a core dep is missing
#   check-deps.sh --all        also list which optional deps are missing
#   check-deps.sh --json       JSON, for the in-app manual check
#   check-deps.sh --page       write the HTML report and open it in a browser
#   check-deps.sh --install    remote-install.sh's report format, from the manifest
#   check-deps.sh --report     post-update path: write the page and open it
#
# Exit codes: 0 = every core dependency present, 1 = core dependency missing,
#             2 = could not run the check at all (bad usage, or no jq/manifest).

# Is a package installed? Answered without asking the package manager.

# `pacman -Q`, `dpkg -s`, `rpm -q` and their relatives all answer this, and all
# of them answer it by starting a program built to do far more than answer it.
# That matters here for two reasons: this runs from the update path against the
# shell's own process environment, which is a plausible place for a command to
# go missing, and a check that forks a package manager once per dependency turns
# a millisecond of reading into a couple of seconds of process startup.
#
# Every mainstream package manager already keeps a record of exactly which
# packages it has installed, in a plain file or a directory of plain files. So
# the same question is answerable by reading that record, which needs no
# package manager, no network, and no elevated privileges — it is a question
# about what is already on this disk.
#
# The entire set is read in one pass rather than queried per dependency, so the
# cost is a fixed couple of greps no matter how many dependencies the manifest
# has. A system with 1139 packages installed is two processes and an
# associative-array fill; every lookup after that is a hash hit.
