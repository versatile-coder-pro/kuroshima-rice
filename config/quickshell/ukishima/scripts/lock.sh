# Ukishima session lock.
#
# One script, two locks. The pill's power menu, a keybind and hypridle all call
# this; which lock you get is the `lockMethod` flag in the ukishima flags.json
# (the same file the shell writes), so the pill and any keybind stay in sync:
#
#   "hyprlock"   → hyprlock, if it is actually installed
#   "quickshell" → the Quickshell lockscreen (lockscreen/shell.qml), which falls
#                  back to hyprlock by itself if Quickshell cannot lock
#
# It used to be two scripts. lock.sh was hyprlock-only; lock-qs.sh was an opt-in
# alternative you picked by pointing `lock_cmd` at one or the other; and adding
# the flag later folded that choice in here — which left lock-qs.sh behind as a
# second front door whose own header still told you to point your idle locker
# at it and thereby skip the flag, the probe and the guard below. Two entry
# points for one decision is the same shape of mistake as the one the guard
# exists to prevent. There is one entry point now.
#
# "hyprlock" is a hand-off, not a mode Ukishima configures. The repo ships no
# hyprlock.conf and generates none, so choosing it discards every visual
# setting on the LOCK surface — background, blur, avatar, indicators — in
# favour of the user's own hyprlock.conf. It is also an external dependency
# that may simply not be installed, so it is probed before use rather than
# exec'd on faith. That probe used to be missing, which meant a machine
# without hyprlock ran `exec hyprlock`, got exit 127, and sat there unlocked.
#
# A missing hyprlock is never a reason to leave the session unlocked. The
# Quickshell lock needs nothing beyond Quickshell itself, so a request for
# hyprlock that cannot be honoured is downgraded to it, and the downgrade is
# logged, not failed. Only when neither exists is this a real failure, and
# then it says so on stderr.

    # back empty or torn.
    #
    # It now also finishes before quickshell is *spawned*, which is the whole
    # fix for a lock that felt slow. This used to run grim concurrently with
    # quickshell's startup so the session would lock without waiting on the
    # encode, on the reasoning that a foreground grim cost ~450ms with the
    # desktop still interactive. That number was a PNG encode; as JPEG the
    # same two-output capture measures ~50ms, far less than the ~271ms the
    # lockscreen process then spends parsing QML before it can show anything.
    # Paying ~50ms to have the picture already on disk when the first frame is
    # mapped costs less wall-clock than overlapping the two did, and it removes
    # the failure the overlap created: the surface came up before the file
    # existed, so LockSurface polled a half-written PNG, re-read it on a 25ms
    # timer, latched status=Error on every truncated attempt and needed 13
    # tries and ~300ms to attach (see the "capture attached after 300ms
    # (attempt 13)" line in the log). The screen showed the wallpaper first and
    # cross-faded to the screenshot after, which is the visible stall.

    # surface itself, which is inherent to capturing after the lock is up.
