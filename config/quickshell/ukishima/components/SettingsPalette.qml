/**
 * The colour contract a settings surface hands to the rows it contains.
 *
 * The row widgets used to reach straight into the pill's `Theme` singleton, which
 * pinned every settings page to the pill's palette: the dock's settings could not
 * be anything but a recoloured copy of a pill surface, and a theme change moved
 * both at once. A palette object is the seam. `SettingsSurface` publishes the
 * pill's tokens; the dock's own settings panel publishes the dock's. The rows
 * read whichever they are given, so the same `SettingsRow` renders either host
 * and neither can reach the other's colours.
 *
 * Every slot is a real colour rather than an optional one, so a host that
 * forgets a slot shows the mistake instead of silently inheriting the pill.
