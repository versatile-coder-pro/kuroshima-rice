/**
 * The PILL's morphing settings surface: the category index and each
 * sub-surface. Carries the pill morphology (the margins below), the glowing
 * row-soul seam, and morphs back to the parent index when empty space is
 * clicked on a sub-surface. The deriving surface sets `rows`, optionally
 * `backSurface`, and lays out its own content column (header, section labels,
 * SettingsRow lines).
 *
 * The row behaviour — the registry, the keyboard cursor and the click/hover
 * routing — lives in `SettingsRows` and is only forwarded from here, so this
 * file is purely the pill's APPEARANCE. That split is what lets the dock grow
 * its own settings surface with the same behaviour and a different look: a
 * change to the pill's margins or seam no longer reaches anything that is not
 * a pill surface, and vice versa.
