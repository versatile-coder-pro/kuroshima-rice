/**
 * macOS-style bottom dock: a floating washi bar showing the pinned apps in
 * their user-chosen order, then a hairline divider, then every running app
 * that is not already pinned. Clicking a running app focuses its window
 * (workspace switch included), clicking a closed one launches its desktop
 * entry; right-click toggles the pin. A window whose class cannot be resolved
 * to a desktop entry still appears while running (icon from the theme) but
 * cannot be pinned, since there is nothing to re-launch.
 *
 * With nothing pinned and nothing running, the bar becomes a shelf of the five
 * most-launched apps from the launcher's usage log (click to launch,
 * right-click to pin — which teaches the affinity with one gesture). With no
 * usage history at all the dock retracts entirely and releases its reserved
 * band (see `empty` / DockState).
 *
 * Pins live in the same state file pattern as launcher usage counts
 * (ukishima/dock-pins.json, an ordered JSON array of desktop entry ids), so
 * they survive restarts and are shared by every monitor's dock. The item list
 * is rebuilt on an interval and whenever pins change, because the toplevel
 * model's .values is not reliably notifiable.
 *
 * Pinned chips can be dragged sideways to reorder them, so the dock's order is
 * purely the user's own liking (see `beginDrag` / `slotForX`). Only pinned
 * chips move: a running-but-unpinned chip has no place in the persistent order,
 * and it is a click target. The unpinned shelf below the divider takes a
 * stable first-seen session order (DockState) instead of a workspace order, so
 * it does not reshuffle as windows travel between workspaces.
