/**
 * The DOCK's own settings surface: the dock's counterpart to `SettingsSurface`,
 * and the reason that file could be reduced to the pill's appearance.
 *
 * The dock's settings used to be a pill sub-surface, which tied three things
 * together that have nothing to do with each other: where the settings were
 * drawn (inside the pill), how they looked (the pill's margins, its glowing row
 * seam, and the pill's `Theme` palette), and how they were opened (an entry in
 * the pill's own surface stack). Changing any of the pill's interface settings
 * therefore changed the dock's, and the dock could not have settings of its own
 * without a second copy of all of it.
 *
 * This is the second host, and it shares only what is genuinely shared:
 *
 *   - `SettingsRows` for the registry, the keyboard cursor and the click/hover
 *     routing — the behaviour, which is host-agnostic.
 *   - `SettingsRow`/`SettingsSeg`/`LinkToggle`/`SettingsHeader` for the row
 *     chrome, which reads whichever palette it is handed.
 *
 * Everything else is the dock's own: it is NOT a `PillSurface`, so it carries
 * no pill margins and no morph, it paints its own backdrop from the dock's
 * palette, and its focus indicator is the focused row's own backdrop rather than
 * the pill's flame seam. The shell places it as a sibling of the dock bar and the
 * dock's gear chip opens it, so the pill's surface stack does not mention it.
 *
 * `pal` is supplied by the host (DockBar), which owns the dock's palette. A
 * panel never derives colours itself, so there is exactly one place where the
 * dock's colours are decided.

     * and the reason is worth keeping in mind before putting anything like it
     * back: the panel is opened from the gear, which is on the BAR, so on the
     * ordinary path the pointer never crosses the panel at all. A host that
     * requires "the pointer was over the panel" before it will dismiss therefore
     * vetoes the exact case it appears to be guarding, and fires only when the
     * pointer happens to have travelled through the panel on its way elsewhere.
     *
     * The host decides instead, from the block it already measures: the panel
     * and the bar are one input region, `hovered` reads as "over either", and
     * the bar's existing leave-grace closes this. See `dismissBase` in
     * shell.qml and `revealTimer` in DockBar.
